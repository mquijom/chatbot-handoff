                    <li>Please present your original ID/s to the Bank. For companies that submit copies of the original
                        IDs, the Corporate Secretary should attest to their authenticity through a notarized

                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">a. Sole Proprietorship</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The photocopy of the Business Name Certificate of Affirmative Business
                    Name Certification with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is acceptable as long as you

                    point-of-entry is not a regulatory mandate, the same is an indicia for purposes of due diligence in
                    establishing the status of the resident-foreigner or alien in the Philippines, and in ensuring that
                    the individual has entered the country legally. To be acceptable, please present your original
                    Passport and ACR I-card (for permanent resident or tourist of more than 180 days) as identification
